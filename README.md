# These are PARI/GP programs
# I am interested in dozenal (duodecimal) numbers, so these programs almost print numbers in dozenal notation, with X=ten and E=eleven.

# "factors" are slower program, "factor qq" and "factor quick" are quicker programs, "factor qq" factors 144 as "2^4 * 3^2", but "factor quick" factors 144 as "2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3"
